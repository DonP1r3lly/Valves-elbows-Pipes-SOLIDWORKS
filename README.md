# Valves-elbows-Pipes-SOLIDWORKS
Mechanical design of valves, pipes, and elbows using SolidWorks. The design was created by DAVID MART√çNEZ.

Three types of parts have been designed for SolidWorks, including photographs of drawings and cross-sections to verify the shapes. Additionally, an .stl file for 3D printing is included.
For a 3D printing research project, I designed three types of parts for use with different materials.

## Pipe joints <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iY8CRBdQXODJSCERIr/giphy.gif" width="30px">&nbsp;
Pipe joints designed to be 3D printed in metal, eliminating the need for welding joints and resulting in a clean piece. The material used is copper.

## Elbow <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iY8CRBdQXODJSCERIr/giphy.gif" width="30px">&nbsp;
A threaded elbow has been designed on both ends, ideal for high-pressure installations. The material used is brass.

## Valve <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iY8CRBdQXODJSCERIr/giphy.gif" width="30px">&nbsp;
High-pressure valve, designed for oilfield installations. The piece consists of three joints. Bolt and screw joints are also included.

## T Type <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/iY8CRBdQXODJSCERIr/giphy.gif" width="30px">&nbsp;
T-type fitting designed for water installations, includes installation threads, and it is advised to be 3D printed in metal to avoid welding and obtain a clean piece. Copper is the material used.
